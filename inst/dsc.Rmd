### GGVEGA

The ggvega package was created to translate from ggplot2 to Vega-Lite in a manner similar to how `ggplotly()` translates from ggplot2 to plotly. 

Motivation for project was to have interactive graphics... take a ggplot and add selections

This project has been supported by Schneider Electric and GSOC.

One of the main goals on the Schneider Electric side of this project is to build & deploy visual components (in html) that can be extensible to new data. (think "update-able" dashboards)


This influenced some of our fundamental design choices. 


<br />

### Why Vega-Lite?

Vega-Lite is developed by Interactive Data Lab, U Washington. Built on Vega, Vega-Lite is more concise, but less expressive.

- JavaScript, rendered in the browser

### Design philosophy

Our  *initial* philosophy was to manage a small set of plots (perhaps something like scatter-plots, line-charts, bar-charts, and histograms), but to manage these translations in a robust way that we can extend in the future. In other words, **a narrow scope built on a firm foundation**.



**Design choice #1**: Do we capture the intention or the implementation?

ggvega seeks to capture the *intent* of a ggplot. This is distinct from the *implementation* of a ggplot (the path `ggplotly()` takes). <!-- Our idea is to let the powerful defaults of the two packages take care of most of the work. In addition, we anticipated (at some point in the distant future) creating a Vega-lite theme for the visual components. -->



<br />


### Our approach

We convert a ggplot2 object into a "ggspec", a JSON-serializable list, and then convert "ggspec" into a Vega-Lite specification.

The idea for "ggspec" was to remain faithful to the ggplot2 object and philosophy and to publish a JSON schema that represents the range of "things" that we will be able to translate, and to provide the means to generate a JSON specification that meets this schema, given a ggplot2 object.

The ggspec should record only those things that deviate from ggplot2 defaults. Accordingly, we think to specify things in Vega-Lite only if they differ from the Vega-Lite defaults. Our goal is to capture the “essence” of the ggplot, its intentions. To replicate the default color-maps and appearance, we recommend using a Vega theme (we hope to propose a better ggplot2-theme for Vega).

The ggschema JSON-specification is then converted into a Vega-Lite JSON-specification. Here, as a first approach, we took inspiration from Vega-Lite itself, which translates a Vega-Lite specification into a Vega specification. This is developed in TypeScript, then compiled into ECMAScript 6 (JavaScript), as described in the [Vega-Lite contribution guide](https://github.com/vega/vega-lite/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#suggested-programming-environment).


<br />


### Limitations

We are very restrictive on the expressions we will allow for aesthetic mappings in ggplot. We currently support variable-names only; the only foreseeable exception to this will be to manage factors.

**Issues with ES5/ES6/V8/node.js**:

**Mismatches between ggplot2 and Vega-Lite**:

- `positionDodge` and `positionJitter` -- Vega-Lite is working on implementing this?

- `geom_path()` based on order (there used to be an order aesthetic?) vs. in Vega-Lite there is an order encoding  

- ordering of ordered factors and being extensible to new data  
  - ex. populations of cities bar chart  
    - In ggplot2, use forcats package to order according to population sie -- cannot capture this because it happens outside the ggplot object.
    - Can we use (create?) a `stat_order()` to do this??


<br />


### Examples: ggvega in use

vegawidget, an htmlwidget within the vegawidget GitHub organization, is used to render the specification created by ggvega. 



```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggvega")
plot <- ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species))

as_vegaspec(plot)
```

Once the Vega-Lite specification has been created, we can use vlbuildr, another package within the vegawidget GitHub organization, to modify the specification. vlbuildr is "a functional approach to building up specifications" and the package contains functions that can add various components to a specification.

```{r}
library("ggplot2")
library("ggvega")
library("vlbuildr")

plot <- ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species))

as_vegaspec(plot) %>%
vl_encode_fill("Species:N")
```

With vlbuildr, we can add selections and conditional encodings without addresssing this issue in ggvega/ggplot2.

<br />

### Potential future paths

**Design choice #2**: Should the transformations take place in R or put into the Vega-lite specification?

Option 1: If the Vega-Lite spec does an aggregate, do the aggregation in R instead of JS so that the resulting htmlwidget has a much smaller data set

Option 2: Have the output (the Vega-Lite specification) act as a component so that we can the change different data sets in and out of the Vega-Lite specification only.

**Questions**: 

- How to capture transformation logic in the Vega-Lite spec so that it can stand more "independently" as a single repository of the intent of the visualization -- for deployments where R is not available?

  - build in R but deploy independently of R

- How to translate an R expression into a JS expression

- How to create a general translation capability between dplyr and a set of Vega-Lite transformations?
