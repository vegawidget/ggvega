The goal of **ggvega** is to translate a ggplot2 object to a Vega-Lite
specification.

``` r
library(ggvega)
#> Welcome to ggvega; this package is not yet fully functional, and is under active development.
library(ggplot2)

p <- 
  ggplot(iris) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Petal.Width, y = Petal.Length, colour = Species))

as_vegaspec(p)
#> Warning: ggSpec.layers[0].geom_params should NOT have additional properties
```

### Important Note

This package is in an *extremely* experimental state, under *very*
active development.

At present, we can translate:

  - `geom_point()`
  - aesthetics: `x`, `y`, `colour`
  - unit-plots; no facetting.

We have plans to expand this capability; presently, we are working out a
system to add new capabilities quickly and reliably.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vegawidget/ggvega")
```
