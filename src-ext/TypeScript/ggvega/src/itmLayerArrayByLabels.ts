/**
 * Modify a layer array according to a set of labels
 *
 * @remark
 * We want to attach a label to the first match that it finds, but we want it
 * to match only once.
 *
 * One way we can do this is to delete an item from the label object as
 * as soon as we match it - this way it can be used no more than once.
 *
 * We need to define what is a match - I think a match is made between:
 *   - a key (aesthetic name) of an encoding object
 *   - a key of a label
 *
 * Is this always an exact match? Perhaps for position channels, x & y,
 * it need match only the first character. A function could be useful here
 * to determine a match between two strings.
 *
 * I think we have to start by looping over the layers.
 *
 * Then we can have a function that takes an (intermediate) encoding object
 * and a label object. This function can loop over both the enconding object
 * and the label object, looking for a match.
 *
 * **Called by**
 * @see layerArray
 *
 *
 * @param itmLayerArray - `itmLayer[]`
 * @param ggLabelObject - `GG.LabelObject`
 *
 * @returns `ItmLayer[]`
