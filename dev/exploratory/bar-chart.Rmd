The purpose of this document is to show how bar-chart examples can be translated.

## "Simple" bar chart

The is the simplest bar chart we can imagine. On the `x`-axis, we have the `class` of the car; on the `y`-axis we have the number of cars (obsewrvations) in each class.

Also note that I have specified the `width` and `height` of the *rendering* of the vegaspec; this is *not* part of the translation.

```{r results='asis'}
dev_gallery("barchart-mpg")
```
