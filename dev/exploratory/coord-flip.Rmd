```{r message=FALSE}
library("ggvega")
library("ggplot2")
library("vegawidget")
```

The idea with `CoordFlip` is that for every (intermediate) layer, for every encoding in the layer:

- an aesthetic whose name begins with an `x` has the (first) `x` in its name replaced with a `y`.
- an aesthetic whose name begins with a `y` has the (first) `y` in its name replaced with an `x`.

It may also be necessary to change the class of the encodings from `VL.XClass` to `VL.YClass`, and vice-versa.

```{r results='asis', echo=FALSE}
