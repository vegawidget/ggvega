/**
 * Modify a layer array according to a set of labels
 * 
 * @remark
 * We want to attach a label to the first match that it finds, but we want it
 * to match only once.
 * 
 * One way we can do this is to delete an item from the label object as
 * as soon as we match it - this way it can be used no more than once.
 * 
 * We need to define what is a match - I think a match is made between:
 *   - a key (aesthetic name) of an encoding object
 *   - a key of a label
 * 
 * Is this always an exact match? Perhaps for position channels, x & y,
 * it need match only the first character. A function could be useful here 
 * to determine a match between two strings.
 * 
 * I think we have to start by looping over the layers. 
 * 
 * Then we can have a function that takes an (intermediate) encoding object
 * and a label object. This function can loop over both the enconding object 
 * and the label object, looking for a match.
 * 
 * **Called by**
 * @see layerArray
 * 
 * 
 * @param itmLayerArray - `itmLayer[]`
 * @param ggLabelObject - `GG.Labels`
 * 
 * @returns `ItmLayer[]`

  //   - get the encoding keys (aesthetic names)
  //   - get the label keys (aesthetic names)
  //   - for each label key:
  //       - if there is a match with an encoding key (first match that is not value-only):
  //           -  set the encoding title to the label value
  //           -  remove the label from the label object
